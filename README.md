# MUYSC (MUographY Simulation Code)

Scripts of the MUYSC code project

This repository contains all the scipts of the **MUographY Simulation Code (MUYSC)**.

+ A). **Topography:** Download the topography of any volcano around the world

+ B). **Ray Tracing:** Metholodogy of the target ray tracing

+ C). **Muon Flux:** Estimation of the muon flux at the observation place by using different models

+ D). **Tomography Views:** Generation of muograms for different observations point for tomographig the target.

+ E). **Telescope Parameters:** Computing of the angular resolution and acceptance of any moun telescope

+ F). **Civil Muography:** Ray tracing of 3D civil models by using a .STL file

+ G). **Energy Loss** Estimation of the energy loss of muons crossing a geological structure. Calculation of the traversing muon flux, opacity and density.
